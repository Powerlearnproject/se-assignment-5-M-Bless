Advantages of Using the Integrated Terminal
Using the integrated terminal within VS Code offers several advantages over using an external terminal:

Convenience and Efficiency:

Having the terminal integrated into the editor means you don’t need to switch between different applications, which can save time and reduce context switching.
You can execute commands, run scripts, and view output without leaving the editor, streamlining your workflow.
Context Awareness:

The integrated terminal opens in the context of your current workspace, so you don’t need to navigate to your project directory manually.
It’s easier to run project-specific commands and scripts because the terminal starts in the correct working directory.
Side-by-Side Code and Terminal:

You can split the editor to view code and terminal output side by side, making it easier to debug issues, monitor script output, and make quick changes to your code.
Integration with Editor Features:

The integrated terminal works seamlessly with VS Code’s features, such as IntelliSense, debugging, and version control.
Output from the terminal can be copied and pasted directly into the editor, and vice versa, facilitating quick edits and command adjustments.
Customization and Settings:

The integrated terminal can be customized to match your preferences, including appearance, shell type, and keybindings.
You can configure terminal profiles for different environments and switch between them easily.
Persistent Sessions:

The integrated terminal sessions persist across VS Code restarts, so you don’t lose your terminal state or history when you close and reopen the editor.

Add Remote Repository:

Open the terminal in VS Code by clicking the Terminal icon in the Activity Bar or pressing `Ctrl+`` (backtick).
Add the GitHub repository as a remote by running:
sh
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
Push Changes to GitHub:

Push your commits to GitHub by running:
sh
Copy code
git push -u origin main
Replace main with the name of your branch if you are using a different branch name.
Key Git Features in VS Code
